      <description>Hello! My name is Steven Tseng, an avid nerd who enjoys tinkering with different aspects of technology, from Arduinos to Cloud Computing.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been very fortunate to have taught from very early in my career to be inquisitive and continously improve. My earliest career began at Hungry Jacks (Burger King), where i learned the importance of customer service, which I applied in my L1 IT Support role.
Building trust &amp;amp; relationships has always been at the front of my endeavours, especially as I began to mature in both my understanding and ability to help resolve issues.</description>
